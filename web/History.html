      <p>In 2012, TC Croporation joined the Formula1 by its racing department RSM and changed its F1 team name as TC Global racing. In the first two years, things were really tough, ROVEY1 and ROVEY2 appeared to be two cars that were less competitive than their decendents. The team's ranking is also left behind.</p></td>

      <p>In this stage, TC founded Techcreate Global Racing Corporation(TGRC) as its racing managment company, and the team's name is also changed to TGRC F1 Team. Since then, TC had increased its support to the team  both technically and finacially, the average level of the team is improving.</p>
      <p>The most remarkable event in this stage is our ROVEY5 racecar got the first pole position of our team in 2017 Singapore Grand Prix. The 2017 season ended as the best season of TGRC F1 team at that time. We ranked 4th on the teams' standing.</p></td>

      <p>After 2017 season, Skystar Group, which was a very importanrt partner of TC Croporation, showed great interest in formula1 racing. After a winter's negotiation, Skystar joined teh F1 by becoming TGRC's partner. The team finally got the final step to victory.</p>
      <p>Soon, in 2018 Spain Grand Prix, we achieved our first win in ROVEY6 racecar. Since then, we have became a one of the most competitive teams in the F1. In 2020 season, ROVEY8 earned our first hat-trick(getting pole position, champion and fastest lap in feature race at the same time).</p>
